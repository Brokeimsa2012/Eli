# My Project

This project is a TypeScript application that sets up a server and includes various routes and middleware. Below are the instructions for setting up and running the application.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Docker (optional, for containerization)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my-project
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Application

To run the application locally, use the following command:

```
npm start
```

This will start the server on the default port (usually 3000). You can access the application by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## Docker

To build and run the application using Docker, follow these steps:

1. Build the Docker image:

   ```
   docker build -t my-project .
   ```

2. Run the Docker container:

   ```
   docker run -p 3000:3000 my-project
   ```

You can then access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.
